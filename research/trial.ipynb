       " 'summary': 'A remotely controlled airship was designed, Fabricated and demonstrated within a tight timespan of under a month after receiving the go-ahead. The main design requirement was to be able to operate from a Helipad located at an altitude of 6,572 feet AMSL under ISA+20 deg.C. Images of the terrain below were recorded during the flight and transmitted in real-time to a ground based system using an onboard telemetry system. Airships are aerodynamically shaped bodies filled with a “Lighter-Than-Air” (LTA) gas that displaces the ambient air, which results in a net upward force due to buoyancy. A remotely controlled (RC) airship is perhaps much more suitable than a remotely controlled aircraft for aerial surveillance due to its long endurance loiter and lower fuel consumption. The RC airship was designed to carry a camera that could take high resolution photographs of the terrain below and transmit them in-real time. It had to operate in very cold weather at a high altitude and the envelope material and fabrication process had to conform to such harsh environmental conditions. The envelope is the most crucial component of the airship and its design demands to optimally integrate the aspects of aerodynamics and stability. The stabilizer and rudder have been designed to have a cruciform shape on the envelope. The envelope material has to be appropriately chosen to ensure adequate strength, durability, as well as low weight. A detailed overview of the power plant system, design issues in engine sizing and selection, advances in engine technology, various concepts for thrust vectoring has been outlined by Gawale and Pant. The center of gravity (CG) of the airship should be exactly at the same location as that of the center of buoyancy (CB) A detailed mass breakup and CG analysis was carried out. The airship CG and CB were estimated to be located 3.79 and 3.64 m from the nose. The gondola was sized to accommodate the receiver, fuel tank, engine and payload. The CAD model of the airship along with the fins and a side view of airship are shown adjacently in Fig. 7. It was observed that an additional ballast weight had to be added  to the gondola in order to attain stability. The airship was successfully flown during three different  weather conditions, viz., dry day, mild rain and mild snowfall. The demonstration established the efficacy of remotely controlled airships for aerial photography and data collection by snow scientists. The author would like to thank Dr. R. N. Sarwade, the Director of Snow and Avalanches Study Establishment, DRDO, for inviting the team from LTA systems Lab of IIT Bombay to carry out the demonstration.
